        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>I don't know what linguini is. I probably won't ever need to. Linguini was one of the words
            in today's NYT Spelling Bee. I'm not a fan of the "ing" days, which they have like every other day.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Tall, thin, doughy cylinders</li>
            <li>Parsley?</li>
            <li>A Plate</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Grab lump of dough, roll into one long noodle</li>
            <li>Configure noodle like a ball of yarn</li>
            <li>Throw against wall, or ceiling</li>
            <li>Put it on a plate, may take some time to clean</li>
        </ol>
